# amidakuji
a place to hold some code while I explore amidakuji or ghost ladder in python, and javascript

live javascrip version here:

came across ghost ladder quite randomly while searching for the music used in the arcade game Frogger

it reminded me of binary mazes 

I have used python to make a path following algorithm 

I still have used a 2d array to encode the ladder 

I still have to write a function that generates a random ladder according to the rules

that horizontals only span one column 

some math discussion here
