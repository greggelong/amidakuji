# amidakuji
a place to hold some code while I explore amidakuji or ghost ladder in python, and javascript

live javascrip version here:

came across ghost ladder quite randomly while searching for the music used in the arcade game Frogger

There was also a video game from the 80s called Amida which used the ghost ladder in the bonus round.

it reminded me of binary mazes 

I have used python to make a path following algorithm 

I have used a 2d array to encode the ladder 

I have written a function  in python that generates a random ladder according to the rules, that horizontals only span one column 


I have also made a version using p5.js to visualize and animate the ladder and the paths
